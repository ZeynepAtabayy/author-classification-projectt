# Author Classification Using Text Mining and Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks implementing various machine learning and deep learning techniques for **author classification**. The project explores traditional ML algorithms and transformer-based models to determine the author of a given text based on its linguistic features.

# Project Overview

The task of **author classification** involves identifying the most likely author of a piece of text using statistical and deep learning techniques. This is a common problem in **stylometry**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **forensic linguistics**.

# Key Objectives

- Extract meaningful features from raw text using **TF-IDF** and **BERT** embeddings.
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models.
- Compare the performance of classical ML algorithms with transformer-based approaches.
- Analyze the results using evaluation metrics like accuracy and classification report.
